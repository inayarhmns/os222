## Week 0

- [Operating System Playlist - Neso Academy](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRiVhbXDGLXDk_OQAeuVcp2O)

     This is the go-to playlist containing videos of OS materials. The content is much like Silberschatz' slides but explained in an interesting lecture. For the first week of OS it includes introduction, basics of computer architecture, types of OS, VM, etc. 
- [What is an Operating System - guru99.com](https://www.guru99.com/operating-system-tutorial.html)

     This site is pretty much a summary about introduction to OS. It covers the fundamental materials concisely and can be comfortably read in minutes. Great to read after watching above videos to remember the gist of it.

## Week 1
---
- [Linux Cheat Sheet - guru99.com](https://www.guru99.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet.html)

     This site provides straight-forward linux syntax and its functions. It's very helpful to refer to when learning to use linux.

- [Linux Regex - guru99 on YouTube](https://youtu.be/mpyCeSvGh-M)     
 
     This video explains Regex and demonstrates how to use them. It is a 5-minute video, so it may not cover every regex ever but by far for me is the most convenient source for just getting to know them! 

## Week 2
--- 
- [Linux File permissions and Ownership Explained - Chris Titus Tech on YouTube](https://youtu.be/k1yzI7c6Fzk)

     This video explains linux file permissions (rwx thingy). Not only is it compact, it provides linux handbook regarding the topic in the video description as well.
- [Vi Editor Tutorial - guru99 on YouTube](https://youtu.be/pU2k776i2Zw)

     Very substantial 7 minute video about Vi editor. It also gives out its website version in video description just in case 7 minutes is too long for us.
- [How to paste to Vi editor from system' clipboard - stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49933556)  

     This is a stackoverflow answer on how to copy and paste from clipboard to Vi editor. Very straight-forward answer using friendly and kind words unlike most stackoverflow answerers <3. 
     
## Week 3
--- 
- [File Systems as Fast As Possible - TechQuickie](https://youtu.be/BV0-EPUYuQc)

     This video is a 6 minute easy-to-follow video about file systems. A great video to understand some basics before getting deep into the file systems presented in our textbook. 

- [mounting and unmounting disks/partitions - BlueMonkey 4n6l](https://youtu.be/F-a_BBAGfkE)
 
     This is a video on how mounting works and the kinds of mounting we can do. It is 18 minutes long but it has video sections so we can skip to whatever part we'd like to watch.
