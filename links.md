## Week 0

- [Operating System Playlist - Neso Academy](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRiVhbXDGLXDk_OQAeuVcp2O)

     This is the go-to playlist containing videos of OS materials. The content is much like Silberschatz' slides but explained in an interesting lecture. For the first week of OS it includes introduction, basics of computer architecture, types of OS, VM, etc. 
- [What is an Operating System - guru99.com](https://www.guru99.com/operating-system-tutorial.html)

     This site is pretty much a summary about introduction to OS. It covers the fundamental materials concisely and can be comfortably read in minutes. Great to read after watching above videos to remember the gist of it.

## Week 1

- [Linux Cheat Sheet - guru99.com](https://www.guru99.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet.html)

     This site provides straight-forward linux syntax and its functions. It's very helpful to refer to when learning to use linux.

- [Linux Regex - guru99 on YouTube](https://youtu.be/mpyCeSvGh-M)     
 
     This video explains Regex and demonstrates how to use them. It is a 5-minute video, so it may not cover every regex ever but by far for me is the most convenient source for just getting to know them!
